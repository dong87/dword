- RESULTS Many epistatic QTLs are part of **highly connected** networks Most epistatic QTLs3 interacted with one or a few loci, while a smaller subset were involved in pairwise interactions with several loci (Fig. 1a). (Forsberg et al., 2017)
- There are many more pairs of cell types that are **highly correlated** than there are **highly correlated** pairs of cell type groups, and we are testing all cell types every time (Supplementary Fig. (Finucane et al., 2015)
- This finding is consistent with the understanding that the genetic component of educational attainment, which excludes environmental factors and population structure, is **highly correlated** with IQ45. (Finucane et al., 2015)
- For the analysis of brain regions, this was because the chromatin annotations that we analyzed were **highly correlated** across different brain regions, and thus some phenotypes showed enrichment in nearly every brain region; we did not consider these nonspecific enrichments to be a meaningful validation of our region-specific results using gene expression data. (Finucane et al., 2018)
- There were two clusters of **highly correlated** tissues for which we decided to remove the entire cluster, not keeping any of the tissues, because these clusters had very strong but biologically implausible correlations. (Finucane et al., 2018)
- However, joint analysis of 13 **highly correlated** annotations is likely to be underpowered, whereas recomputing t-statistics within the brain allows us to construct new annotations with lower correlations (Supplementary Fig. 7), increasing our power. (Finucane et al., 2018)
- We chose to exclude other brain regions because we wanted to include genes that were more **highly expressed** in brain tissues than in non-brain tissues, even if they were not specific to the cortex region within the brain. (Finucane et al., 2018)
- Together, this shows that strong genetic capacitors14,15 often are hubs in epistatic networks. a 250 200 150 100 50 0 2 b Xylose 4 6 8 10 Number of genetic interactions Cobalt chloride Manganese sulfate 12 YPD Zeocin E6 Berbamine Indole acetic acid Lactate Copper sulfate Neomycin Raffinose Figure 1 Many QTLs involved in pairwise interactions are part of **highly interconnected** epistatic networks.

- Few QTLs are involved in many interactions, here defined as five or more, but their role is prominent because they are the hubs that tie the networks together. (b) The pairwise QTL interactions contributing to growth in 11 different media form **highly interconnected** epistatic networks. (Forsberg et al., 2017)
- We provide several exam- ples of such epistasis, involving multiple loci in **highly interconnected** genetic networks. (Forsberg et al., 2017)
- First, our approach will not detect strong but **highly localized** signals. (Finucane et al., 2018)
